.SH SYNOPSIS
.B minios-installer
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B minios-installer
is a GTK3 graphical utility for installing MiniOS from a live session to a permanent disk installation. It provides a step-by-step interface for disk selection, partitioning, formatting, file copying, and bootloader configuration.
.PP
The installer supports both BIOS and UEFI systems with automatic detection and configuration. It creates the necessary partitions, formats them with the selected filesystem, copies all MiniOS files, and installs the appropriate bootloader (GRUB or Syslinux).
